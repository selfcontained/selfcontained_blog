[Grab a free chapter][free-chapter] of the latest [YUI][] book from Packt Publishing, "**YUI 2.8: Learning the Library**."  The free chapter covers something we all use a lot, menus.  I'm checking it out now, and suggest if you use, or are thinking about using YUI, you do the same since it's free.

I've been using YUI for about 4 years now, and love it.  I love the solid foundation it provides for me to build my own interfaces on top of.  I love the polished UI elements it provides as well.  I'm looking forward to reading this book in its entirety.  Check back soon for a full review of it.
