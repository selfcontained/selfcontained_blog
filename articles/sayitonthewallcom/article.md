Today I finished up the work needed for [SayItOnTheWall.com][] to go live.  I had a lot of fun working on this site as I got to use dojo for the first time in a full project, and really enjoyed it.  The site was created for a business my wife has started up to create and sell Vinyl wall words as home decorations.  From a technical point of view, it utilizes an Ajax shopping cart that I created, along with a ["build-your-own" saying component][saying] that lets customers pick and choose from a large collection of fonts, colors and sizes, and see what they're saying will look like on the spot.
