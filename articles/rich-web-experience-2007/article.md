I was lucky enough to be able attend the Rich Web Experience this year, put on by NFJS.  We're on the 2nd day of the conference, and so far its been great.  I got to attend a great presentation by Greg Murray on [jMaki][].  Those guys are doing some interesting work on that project that seems to wrap up a number of js frameworks pretty well, and provide a common api/interface for using them in conjunction with eachother.

Other highlights of day 1 were Douglas Crockford's presentation on Javascript: The Good Parts, and his keynote on The State of Ajax.  Its great to get to hear from someone who has a lot of personal experience in the history of the language and get his insight.  So far its been great, and I'm looking forwad to day 2!
