Recently a question was posted on Quora, "[How could YUI3 improve its image compared to jQuery, MooTools, etc.?][question]".  John Resig, of jQuery fame, gave a great answer on his thoughts to the question.  [Nicholas Zakas responds][response] with another great explanation of why he doesn't think the comparison is needed.  I disagree with Zakas in regards to [jQuery not being sufficient for "scalable web applications"][jquery].  Both have great points, and are worth a read if you're actively involved with frontend engineering.
