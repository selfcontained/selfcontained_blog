After a bit of work, I finally got my first iPhone app on the App store.  It's nothing extraordinary, but was a learning experience for the most part.  It's called **LDS Gems**, and is an easier way to manage, read, and share the quotes and stories provided by the LDS church at <http://gems.lds.org>.

I used [Titanium Appcelerator][titanium] to build it, and was really impressed with how much easier it was to develop using Javascript as opposed to Objective-C.  This is probably due to having quite a bit more experience with Javascript than the later, but I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone wanting to dive into iPhone App development, but not ready to take on learning Objective-C.
